We did no traveling today, so I'm lacking both a map and an elevation profile.

Mike and I mostly spent the day on the sofa or at the kitchen table hunched over
maps. I banged away on the netbook, trying to catch up on the dailies. My legs
were humming, as though they'd been plugged into a power-outlet, which seemed to
be a good thing.

Later in the day, some friends of the Jordans came over and a cookout was held.
Steak was eaten, french fries were scarfed, and Mary Jean even allowed me both a
piece of peach cobbler *and* a piece of strawberry pie for desert. 

We talked for a while about our trip and then about the state of public
education.

After snapping a few pictures for the blog, Mike and I retired to sleep off the
pie and prepare for the road ahead.

The Jordans were incredibly sweet to us; our deepest thanks go out to them.
