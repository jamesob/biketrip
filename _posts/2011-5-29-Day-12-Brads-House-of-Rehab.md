The morning of Sunday, May 29, the two of us awoke to sunlight streaming through
the open door of our hut behind the Cumberland County fire station. I got up
pretty immediately, grabbed my hygiene gear, and headed inside for a walk
through the station to the bathroom. 

On the way to the bathroom, I passed a few of the firemen watching TV in a dimly
lit room --- a great plan for around 6:30 in the morning. They told me that I
was welcome to take a shower and that there were clean towels in the bathroom.
Having woken up feeling slimy and grit-covered, I wasted no time in accepting.

After the hygiene dance, changing into bike clothes, and repacking the bikes,
Mike and I requested a picture with the firemen.

After expressing our gratitude and chatting a little more, we skedaddled for the
McDonald's.

McDonald's is always an interesting scene in the morning, and it varies
from town to town. Sometimes, there'll be tables full of people munching and
talking quietly, out of reverence for the early morning. This particular
morning, there was a lone, well-dressed guy sitting in the McDonald's looking
friendly but forlorn. We said hello, then made a beeline for the food.

After McDonald's, we started the long, empty road to McMinnville. The route
lacked the usual abundance of gas stations, so we had to be careful with water
consumption and take advantage of any opportunity that came along. The terrain
was a little hilly, but nothing too bad.

We only had 42 miles to go before hitting the Walmart in McMinnville, which was
where our CouchSurfing host for the night lived.

We stopped in the early afternoon for lunch at the only restaurant we'd seen all
day, a place called Gribble's Landing. I wish I'd gotten a picture of the
inside, because it would immediately explain what I may struggle to describe
with a few paragraphs.

Gribble's Landing was an alter of home cookin'. Maybe 20 families were seated at
the establishment, which was a single giant room with large, cheap tables and
flimsy, plastic chairs. Blond, tan southern girls ran around taking orders and
refilling sweet teas. The distribution of age in the place was bimodal: a
customer was either 6 or 60.

Mike and I walked in looking like we were from another planet. We were totally
lost in the chaos of this place, and we milled around for a few minutes before
getting approached by some kind soul who saw that we were obviously out of our
element. She told us to find a table ourselves, despite a sign telling us to
wait to be seated.

We seated ourselves and I flagged one of the girls down for two menus. Minutes
later, she arrived back at the table with a Dr. Pepper for me and a sweet tea
for Mike. Extremely hungry, we then attacked the buffet, where food was
dispensed at the whim of an older, unenthusiastic woman. I got roast beef, fried
chicken, green beans, potatos, and a dinner roll.

We returned to our table and disappeared the food without pause. The girl would
periodically land next to our table, asking questions or alotting refills,
taking off immediately afterwards to some other corner of the room.

After we'd finished our refills, a woman who seemed confident and gaudy enough
to be the proprietor came over and asked if we'd like some pie for desert. The
two of us responded quickly in the affirmative and so she started rattling off a
list of pies available, the number of which must have been near 20. Mike
apparently took interest in one of the flavors and asked her to described it (I
think it was French Coconut). She replied that it was sort of like a "chess"
pie. I asked her what a chess pie was and she turned to me looking as though I'd
just stabbed Elvis. The woman must have stared at me a solid 5 seconds without
saying a word, and she didn't respond to my question. I ordered chocolate and
Mike went with the still-mysterious french coconut.

After inhaling the pies in the amount of time it would take a normal person to
put on a shirt, Mike went off to the bathroom and I sat, letting the boulder in
my stomach erode. I couldn't help but feel slightly out of place. Though, in
some sense, that's what the trip is about.

Mike came back and we did more sitting until the pie-woman came over again and
told us, in the saccharine language of a steel magnolia, that it was time for us to
pay up and get the hell out.  We gathered our stuff and found the register,
where the tan girl squared us.

The ride from the Landing into McMinnville was uneventful, but hot. I hadn't put
sunscreen on my face, so when we arrived at the Walmart, I felt like I'd shaved
with a welding torch.

We kicked around the Walmart for a while, picking up sewing supplies so that we
could attach the Cumberland Co. Fire Dept. patches that the firemen had given us
to our panniers. Like true vagrant cyclists, we roosted in the Walmart
McDonald's for hours, Mike sewing and I pounding out an update. Eventually, it
got to be around 6PM, so I called our host for the evening, Brad.

Brad told us to come on over to his place any time, so we paid up at the
Walmart, loaded our bikes, and headed for Brad's. I managed to discover a broken
spoke on the way over[^1], but we decided not to fuss with it because we were
so excited to get to Brad's.

Meeting people from the internet is always interesting, and it's a rare treat
when someone lives up to their internet persona. Brad was one such case. We'd
been swapping a few messages with Brad for the past four days. Each message from
Brad was a well-written, friendly encouragement to come on by his house for some
food and relaxation.

I didn't know what to expect from the guy, but not one minute after walking into
his house, he had us laughing. Brad was a totally natural fit for the two of us
and we settled into conversation without a seam.

We sat talking with Brad about music, the trip, himself, McMinnville, and a
variety of other things. We enjoyed the atmosphere of his house; everything was
extremely clean, but very cosy and full of eclectic decoration. He had a knight
covered in Mardi Gras beads caty corner to a wall on which his TV/computer feed
was projected. Good music was playing.

We changed, cracked some beers, and settled in. Brad showed us a music community
he'd set up on facebook, The WELL, and comically explained the stringent
requirements necessary to gain (and maintain) membership. Brad had some concerns
about his network security, so Mike and I checked out his router configuration.
For a self-described "non-tech" guy, Brad had the lingo and concepts down pat.

Eventually, a banquet broke out. Brad served up some awesome barbecue, in
addition to various other dishes and some killer 'slaw.

Brad's longtime friend Mark showed up later on and was curious about the trip.
We talked to him for a while. He seemed to be broadly knowledgeable. A few other
people showed up ("Sketch," Jimmy, Jessica, and Dale, a big dude in overalls
who, in Brad's words, is "country as cornbread").

We all hung out a while, drinking brews and watching the projector throw colored
light up on Brad's living-room wall. I stuffed myself silly with barbecue and
Mike talked a good amount to Mark. Brad showed us a few of Widespread Panic[^3]'s
live covers on DVD, which included songs from The Grateful Dead and Buffalo
Springfield.

After watching a few episodes of a certain television program about debaucherous
antics in the South[^2], everyone cleared out. Mike and I turned in for a solid
night's rest.

CouchSurfing has worked out really well for us so far and has added numerous
dimensions to the trip. Meeting new people keeps Mike and I sane, and when the
hosts are as cool as Brad, it's really enjoyable.
