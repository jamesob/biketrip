Fueled by the realization that the semester is almost over,
James, Vanessa and I managed to book it from Fairfax to DuPont circle just in
time to miss the departure of the DC critical mass ride. However, with some
expert navigation and luck, we managed to meet up with the mass near K street.
From there, some older couple on a tandem took control of the mass and led us
on some tedious route. Eventually, Vanessa and I managed to wrangle control and
take the mass to "Future Park." That managed to kill the ride and get
everyone else lost since none ever goes to Southwest. 

In classic James fashion, we had been biking for the entire evening without
eating anything. Fortunately, Amsterdam Falafel was only halfway across the
city, so we went there for me to fail to convince a drunk guy that although
there was no meat in the Falafel it was still delicious. 

Then there was beer.

Beer allowed us to determine that my bike can carry the weight of two adults
without issue as well as allow us to sleep in someone's place in Foggy Bottom. 

After 3 and a half hours of dreamless sleep, We were making breakfast and off
to the Velocity Bike CoOp to meet up with TStephens and make our bikes even
more awesome.
