<p>Met up with Will Bartlett in at the Caboose in Vienna for a nice, hilly ride
through McLean and Arlington. Lots of steep grades, two bananas. We initially
planned on going a leisurely pace, but we didn't.</p>
<p>Things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>James was "too tired" to go biking since he was up until 4 a.m. the previous
night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some guy honked and flipped me the bird as he passed Will and I on a 25 mph
road when we were going about 22 mph.</p>
</li>
