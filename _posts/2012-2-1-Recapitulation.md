## Arrival

On July 14, 2011, Mike and I rolled across the golden gate bridge. We'd traveled
just under 3600 miles from when we'd started our trip in northern Virginia, 59
days prior. When we were halfway across the bridge, my front left pannier gave
out and tumbled off my bike.  I'd joked throughout the trip that I expected my
entire bike to crumble similarly, right when we crossed the city limits, like at
the end of *The Blues Brothers*. 

The afternoon air was thick with fog. The damp air settled on us as
we dismounted from our bikes on the other side of the bridge. It was surreal,
finally being in San Francisco. It didn't seem like a big deal. It was just
another day of getting up and riding somewhere. No showy fanfare. No
psychological breakdowns. No sudden rush of sage enlightenment. Just a big,
rust-colored bridge and a pretty skyline veiled in the mist.

We biked through the city to the Haight, where we stayed with our kind hosts,
Nancy and Mike, on Broderick and Divisidero. I spent the next few days trying to
collect myself, mostly in isolation and trying to avoid
action. Mike, characteristically, spent those days exploring the city determinedly
on his bike.

When I would lay down to go to sleep at night in Mike and Nancy's living room,
memories from the past 59 days would whirl under my eyelids and overwhelm me.
From the biking through a Tulsa park at night, sluggish on beer, to
the terror and beauty of going up the Blue Ridge mountains, to the desolate
towns of Arkansas, to the quiet desolation of Nevada, all in rapid succession.
It resulted in something like vertigo.

By the time we got to San Francisco, we'd crossed the wind-tunneled valleys of
Utah; we'd fared highway 50, the loneliest highway in America, through the
mountain-passes and deserts of Nevada. We'd entered California (by way of Lake
Tahoe) and I'd gaped at her immutable coolness. Along the way, we'd stayed
with incredible people who deserve to be written about.

## Loss

We'd done these things without me chronicling them along the way. The
terrain was massive and demanding (had been since the Rockies) and I was out
of steam. It was all I could do to bike through a day and find a place to
sleep at the end of it.

Now, in February, I kick myself for not taking the effort to record the
minutiae, the good stuff. But I'm still not sure if I could have done it. In
any case, the matter was closed when my laptop kicked the bucket in a hotel
outside of Sacramento.

I do feel raw about leaving this blog unfinished.  I have tried a few times to
sit down and complete the entries, but the detail has vanished from my mind. I
know in plain terms what we did each day, and I have the rich, overwhelming
memories, but they're scattered and unindexed. 

I don't have the mental faculty to call to mind what I was thinking about on
each of these days, what I was experiencing. Without that information, this blog
would be nothing but a map and an impersonal itinerary. I can't continue the
writing in the same fashion as when the days were fresh in my mind and
for that reason I do not have plans to complete the blog. 

I apologize to the people who tracked with us through the journey. Your support
and writings were so appreciated.

## Observations
 
It's rare that a day goes by when I don't think about this trip. Sometimes the
nostalgia pulls hard, and I close my eyes, pretending I'm back in the Rockies
with Mike and my bike; or in Payson, Utah at the Caldwell's house; or in
Bumscrew, Arkansas, collapsed in the Hillbilly Motel; or waving bye to my
family, early on a June morning.

Some of the recurring things I thought about during the trip follow.
       
### Pain

The pain, the physical intensity of this trip, is what made the experience.
Without that, I would've just been watching TV; sitting behind glass with the
country drifting by. It was the hardships of not having a hotel, a motor, a shower,
a constant source of food that made this trip so unimaginably foreign and
remarkable. It was because we we were acting vagrants that we met the
wonderful people we did.

</div>
  
There is no free lunch. The lows set the context for the highs. Holding back
tears in the Kansas wind made the passes of the Rockies all the more enjoyable.

I'm happy I took the risk. I now realize that 
discomfort is a necessary prerequisite to any life-changing experience.

### Time

Real adventures take months. I realized I have to plan on a grand scale; it
takes more than a week or two to get into a trip, to adapt to whatever odd
lifestyle I've adopted. It took me until we were in the middle of Colorado to
get up in the morning and jump on the bike, fully primed to face whatever was
next. 

It takes my mind a while to break out of the patterns that it creates for
itself from day to day. I'm not saying these patterns are bad, but giving myself
a chance to break out of them every few years probably isn't a bad idea.

    their 60s who completed a cross-country bike tour the year prior.

### Less is more

Having everything I needed to live strapped to my bike was a luxury. Being
completely mobile is a luxury. On the scale of years, I'd find being nomadic
unproductive and maddening, but for a few months it's refreshing. 

Bills, career, friends, traffic, housing: these things (or their results) enrich
my life for the most part, but a break from them was wonderful. Physical
exertion, an unbounded diet, and the occasional bout of writing was just what
the doctor ordered for the quarter-life crisis I was having.
             
## In closing

I haven't reached the kind of closure with the trip that would be put me fully
at ease. Even had I finished the blog completely, I don't think that would've
granted me the kind of ending I expected. Six months afterwards, I'm still
stewing on the events of this trip, and I expect that contemplation to
continue for a long time.

I can say with certainty that this trip is one of the best things I've ever done
with my life. As we were rounding a particular bend on the Flume trail,
precariously situated a few hundred feet above Lake Tahoe on mountain bikes, our
guide told Mike and me that the first experience only comes once and you can
never recreate it.  I'm grateful that my first cross-country tour was alongside
Mike; he's a stand-up guy. 

Every day since, part of me wishes I were back on the road,
continuing the adventure. I haven't asked, but I can only assume Mike feels
similarly.

Thanks so much to the wonderful people we met on this adventure; I can't express
my gratitude in full over a web page. I think of each of you often. You've
given my life new depth and dimension, and here I'll also venture that Mike
feels similarly.

I encourage anyone inspired by this blog to make something of that inspiration.
Make big plans. Save money[^1]. Find a partner to keep you honest and on
schedule.  Whatever you do, just make sure you're aiming to experience the world
and the people in it. It's wonderful out there.

Yours,
