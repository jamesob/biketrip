Tulsa is everything that Coppola's *Rumble Fish* led me to expect; all manmade
gleam, western neon, and noiry art-deco.

We came into the city through the west along 412, a sun-soaked strip of discount
body shops and 'spic food. The roads were reasonably well-paved, especially
relative to the outskirts of Memphis. Zagging neon lettering already advertised
Tulsa's fascination with the modern as envisioned in the hopeful fifties.

Tulsa is a hip half-indian cowgirl toting a laser-tipped popgun, eating a greasy
burger in a streamlined, chromium diner and blasting rockabilly through cheap
headphones. I knew this when I saw the skyline, riding in, framed by the
coffeeshops, rusted garages, and pool-halls below.

Tulsa, and I imagine Oklahoma in general, is confused and unique in part because
of location. It isn't quite the south or the west, but some strange meeting of
the two. Oklahoma is the buffer between Texas and Kansas, standing behind the
brash, dip-spitting former and gazing into the unending empty plains of the
latter.
                   
Mike and I made quick tracks through the hinterlands and into the city, our legs
primed and pumping at full capacity from the day's ninety-mile ride. We turned
off of 15th onto Cinnci and found our host's place, a spacious two-bedroom in
an up-scale, victorian cluster of apartments[^4].

We met Wendelene outside of the complex just as she was setting out for
downtown. After a quick hello, Mike and I changed in the apartment, stripped
the gear off our bikes, then took the unburdened frames out for a ride to find
dinner.

After meandering around a strikingly-beautiful (but dead) business district, we
finally found an upscale restaurant to eat at. The place was pricey, but Mike
was starving and therefore not long on patience.  When you travel in a group, you
have to take into consideration the hunger-level of every constituent; one
collapses and everyone is miserable. I've been in a similar spot and I know it
isn't fun, so I agreed to stop despite the pricey appearance.

</div>
     

We walked in. The lavish silverware arrangments and dark wood scared the hell
out of me. 

I sat down and warmed up to the idea of a good meal, watching a lone
serviceman nurse a plate of chicken in a booth across the room from us; he
looked eager and friendly but had the bashful loneliness that's tough to shake
when alone in an unfamiliar city.

We then ate about the best $25 meal I've ever tasted. I ordered meatloaf, served
with mashed potatoes and broccoli, and a pint of Shiner Bock. Our waiter was a
slick mulatto with a voice that had a thread-count of at least 300. 

During dinner, a heavy rain swelled for a few minutes, eventually petering out
like a spat between temperamental newlyweds.

We finished up at the Daily Grill and called Wen; she had just rode down to
Archer and Main, where a bicycle race was being held. I almost passed it up
because I was beat; glad I didn't.

We biked down to Archer and Main through the fresh, wet streets. After a
few blocks, Main was walled off to motorists and we biked into a throng of
onlookers, all staring at a street closed to traffic and reserved for the flock
of racers who would periodically rush by, whipping air and coaxing excited yells
from the crowd.

We looked around a moment at the convoy of trucks branded by bicycle companies
and the bars across the street. The sun was just setting. We continued the hunt
for Wen by crossing the racecourse at the go-ahead of a cop working the
crossing.

All sides of the closed street were pulsing with laughter and drinking. The
crowd was large enough to make us believe we were in a city but small enough to
feel like a comfortable, successful block party. Music spilled out of the bars
and flooded the sidewalk. The sun was just setting; artificial light began to
overtake natural.

We kept north on Main still in search of Wen. Mike got antsy and hopped into a
bar, returning with a beer, when I got a call from Wen giving us more detailed
directions. 

We met her and some friends in front of a bratwurst stand. It was Wen, Jenny: a
hilariously outspoken girl; Derya, Wen's Hungarian, electrical-engineering, and
delicate rooommate; and Daniel, a well-built, blonde Californian about 5'10"
also couchsurfing with Wen. Daniel was in town for a century around Tulsa,
starting early the next morning.

We chatted for a while with the group, then I accompanied Jenny to Crystal
Pistols, an atmospheric saloon where Elliot Smith played over the speakers.
Jenny paid the barman $10 for five cans of PBR and we smuggled the cans out in
my backpack while the barman cooperatively turned his back. We repeated this
same routine two or three more times throughout the night.

The drinking began.

We watched the race for a while and it got dark. I was ecstatic, taking in the
energy generated by the crowd and standing in the shimmering Tulsan lights. The
mammoth skyline sat cooly a mile away and searchlights swung smoothly through
the darkened sky. The flow of beer consumed in open air lightened me and the
group talked and laughed until the apogee and end of the race.

After the race ended, we hung on for a while at our post and then started south
on Main to a bar. Jenny, Mike, and I hung outside in a dim area beside the bar,
enjoying the night air and talking the talk of blossoming drunks. I admired
Jenny's pocket notepad, which contained a skeleton itinerary for each day of the
week, handwritten and doodled.

Derya eventually pulled us inside the bar, where I no longer needed to stash
beer in my backpack like some off-color Santa Clause. We got drinks and then
hit the dancefloor. The DJ spun 80s remixes and even an LCD Soundsystem track.
Tulsans can dance. We moved with unencumbered, cartoonish freedom and we danced
with a glow reserved for coming-of-age movies about high school house parties. I
think the place was called The Soundpony Saloon.

After a few tracks on the floor, we left the bar and stood outside it in the
middle of the street. The girls were oggling a group of spandex-clad racers
while Mike and I joked around with Daniel. 

Daniel had landed a job in McAllister, OK working at an ammunitions factory.
He'd met up with Wen through a CouchSurfing potluck held in Tulsa. He reminded
me a lot of a good friend from home, Alex Katzenstein. A cop car, lights active,
crawled by.

After a while, we peeled the girls off the bikers and began the bike to Joe
Momma's, where, allegedly, pizza could be purchased in giant slices and cups of
High Life could be had at $1[^1]. Everyone in the group unlocked their bikes and
we rode south on Main.

Jenny was drunk off her ass, so she tore out ahead, running a light and climbing
the bridge on Main. We tried to stop her, since she was about to ride the wrong
way down a major one-way street, but our shouts were only met with more
pedaling. I tore off after her while the group tried to figure out what to do.

A minor misadventure followed, eventually putting us all at Joe Momma's after a
wild chase after Jenny down 1st and going the wrong way.

We saddled up to a big table at Joe's and ordered a large pie and some
beers. We snapped the first pie up, then placed an order for a replacement and
two pitchers (*two pitchers*) of High Life. Jenny somehow found an electric
guitar and began to serenade us, much to the delight of another customer who was
suit-and-tie'd and named Joshua.

Despite our best attempts to kill the pitchers, we ended up pouring the remnants
into our waterbottles[^2] and leaving Joe's.
    
Jenny again escaped on bike, choosing an impressively dangerous route back to
Wen's apartment. This time, Mike chased after her.

Daniel and I biked together, the other two girls following close behind, and we
talked while passing the High Life waterbottle back and forth. I liked biking
discombobulated on the darkened pedestrian trail

This whole night was made possible, I realized, by the strangers we'd met on the
internet. We were tight with a group, even if we'd only known them for a few
hours, and that made the night. When you're traveling, other people are your
greatest resource. Tap the locals and you are far more likely to have a good
time in a foreign place.

Someone driving my body carried my bike up the wooden, outdoor staircase and
rested it outside of Wen's door. The same ghost had me take out my contacts
and unroll my sleeping bag. Daniel, Mike, and I crashed in the living
room at approximately 2AM. 

I slept like I had been wandering drunk over a mutt city after biking
ninety miles.

[^1]: as you can probably guess by now, any attempts at avoiding Joe Momma's
would be futile
[^2]: like any self-respecting, lush bicyclists
[^4]: to give you a idea of how incredibly cheap Tulsa is to live in, Wen's
awesome, centrally-located apartment can be *bought* for $59k. $59k!
