Met up with Will Bartlett in at the Caboose in Vienna for a nice, hilly ride
through McLean and Arlington. Lots of steep grades and two bananas. We initially
planned on going at a leisurely pace, but we didn't.

Things to note:

* James was "too tired" to go biking since he was up until 4 a.m.\ the previous
night.

* Some guy honked and flipped me the bird as he passed Will and I on a 25 mph
road when we were going about 22 mph.
