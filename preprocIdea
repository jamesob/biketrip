load up post via file.open

readlines it

iterate through the readlines until a line is found which starts with %%% or
something

eval the line after removing the %%% while making a note of the index we are
at in the readlines, call this index i

pray that the line contains a dictionary of useful stuff like
    date
    mapUrl(kml)
    CSSTags?

download the kml and do a .read() on it

parse the kml

generate elevation profile & map (save based on date)

generate the html to present these two images

replace the readlines[i] with this generated html code

write the preprocessed file

EXTRA write a script which will call the preprocessor, figureout from the
preprocessor which files need to be staged, stage them, commit them and push
them.
