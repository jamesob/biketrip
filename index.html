    <p>One night in the dead of January, I met my friend Mike Atkins in a bar
    called Galaxy Hut in Alexandria, VA. After settling down with a few brews,
    Mike told me about a plan he had to ride across the United States on his
    bicycle. 

    <p>I didn't know anything about bicycles, but I knew this was a fantastic
    idea. I leapt at it. The two of us immediately got me situated with some
    gear and we got to training. And now here we are, ready to leave on May
    18. Within these pages is our story, some information on how we got
    bootstrapped (as cheaply as possible!), and a daily log of our trip.
