<h2>A few points</h2>

<ul>

  <li><p>We leave on Wednesday May 18 2011.
  <li><p>The length of the trip is projected at <b>56 days</b>; we didn't budget in any
  rest days, since we have no idea how many will be necessary. We may also spend
  a few days tooling around a few particularly cool areas as per 
  recommendations we've received:
  <ul class="oneLineList">
    <li>Lake Tahoe
    <li>Napa Valley, CA
    <li>Tulsa, OK
  </ul>
  We'd love to hear about any other places worth getting to know.

  <li><p>We're assuming we'll average <b>60 miles per day</b>. This will certainly
  vary based on the day's elevation change. It isn't as ambitious as it sounds.

  <li><p>Once we get to San Francisco, we'll be bumming around for a week or so.
  This will probably entail sleeping in parks, meeting characters, and
  experiencing vagrancy in what must be the closest city to a b&b for homeless.
  We'll fly back when we get tired, run out of money, or hit the end of July.

  <li><p>We'll mostly be <b>camping</b>, "stealth" and otherwise. We're of course
  on the lookout for people on <a
    href="http://couchsurfing.org">couchsurfing.org</a> who're brave enough to
  put us up for a night. The main aim here is to mitigate costs, with "meet
  interesting people" at a close second. Motels will be avoided.

</ul>
