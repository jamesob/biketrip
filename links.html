  <p>Oh my god. The Closeout King. We got numerous things here on the cheap and
  saved a ton of dough. Especially on panniers.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>
    <p>What's to say? Deals abound. We even developed a little product searching
    algorithm (nerds): 
      <ol>
        <li>Search for thing</li>
        <li>Filter for Prime shipping</li>
        <li>Sort by price</li>
        <li>Filter for 3 stars+</li>
      </ol>
    <p>Mike's talking about publishing a paper. We saved stacks.

  <li><a href="http://www.craigslist.com">Craigslist</a>
    <p>Where else you can get a used 90s mountain bike in superb condition on
    the cheap? I don't know. I don't want to know.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://velocitycoop.org/">VÃ©locity Bicycle Cooperative</a>
    <p>Ludicrous prices on used parts, good tools, volunteers with years of
    experience, what more could you want?
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/">Crazy Guy on a Bike</a>
    <p>A great resource with tons of content. The journals were inspiring,
    interesting, and slightly terrifying.
  </li>

  <li><p><a href="http://www.daystarbotanicals.com/biketrip/packinglist.html">This
    nutcase</a> has a ton of good information, including a very extensive
    packing list. Though instead of the Bible, we opted for a 24 of High Life.
</ul>
