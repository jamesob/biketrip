We woke up in our strangely inclined tent on the morning of day 4 and we were
ambitious. We'd taken half the last day off after the insane bout of climbing
we'd done in hopes that it would prepare us adequately for round two with the
Parkway. What naive children.
 
Waking up was excellent. We were inclined downward, our feet lower than our
heads, and we'd left the window of the tent transluscent so we could see bits of
sunlight stream through the foliage.
                                    
Eventually we got up and began to disassemble tent and do myriad other things
that have become routine over the last few days, e.g.

<ul>
  <li>sterilizing my hands and inserting contact lenses within the tent,</li>
  <li>changing into biking clothes and applying chamois cream in, ahem, the
  right places,</li>
  <li>taking care of business with the help of a tense squat, a half-roll of
  toilet paper, and a trowel,</li>
  <li>disassembling our tent, </li>
  <li>repacking our bikes,,</li>
  <li>recovering the food bags from wherever we hid them from the bears,</li>
</ul>

etc. We've gotten the whole rigamoral down to a routine and, at this point, we
can usually get out of dodge within an hour. This particular morning took a
little longer because we were still a little green behind the ears.

We didn't cook anything in the interest of time. We knew it was going to be a
big day... we just didn't know how big. We scarfed some trail-mix and got rolling.

The first portion of the day, as you've probably discerned from the elevation
profile, was basically all downhill with a few climbs interspersed. This was
awesome; imagine going down a road at 30MPH on a chair surrounded by Bavarian
scenery. Awesome.

We did this for a few hours and, by noon, we'd gained 40 miles and lost about
2200 feet of elevation. We were jazzed at the gain, but slightly nervous about
whatever it was we'd have to do in return.

By this point, we were getting lower on food than we're comfortable with.
Luckily, we saw that near the end of our descent, there'd be a restaraunt right
on the Parkway. We got to the advertised location and, to our horror, the place
was more boarded up than half a block of Detroit. A campground was nearby, so we
decided to go get some information from the attendant working the check-in desk.

We doddled around for a while, looking at a map of Virginia, while she talked to
some elderly couple who were complaining about rich folk driving million dollar
campers pulled by Hummers. I smirked at old people griping like that (does
anyone who respects themselves gripe to strangers?) and went back to the map.

After a long, long while, the couple left and we cornered the lady working the
desk. She very promptly told us that, yes, the building with half a facade of
plywood was in fact a closed restaurant, *but*, there was a
restaurant/convenience store just a few miles out of town. The two of us hungry
morons rapidly become bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and giggled like
twelve-year-olds over the prospect of more trail-mix and maybe a hamburger. The
lady gave us directions and we split.

The directions took us out to a place called Big Island. We didn't find the
island, but we did find the H&H Restaurant, which will serve you a half-pound
hamburger for $3.19. Mike and I parked our bikes, gathered all the electronics
gear, and went in. There was a group of blossoming Good 'Ol boys and girls about
our age sitting at a table in the center of the place, wearing T-shirts
outfitted with four-wheeling pictures and rebel pride slogans. They seemed nice
enough.

We gave our order to our black waitress, who had the conversational presence of
a piece of dried leather. That being said, she got us our bbq-pork sandwiches
just fine, and we chowed down while surreptitiously setting up our electronics
to charge.

After chowing, I did a few site updates and threw some of the newer photos on
Flickr. Then we looked at [the
profile](http://www.takecontrol.net/chicken_tales/tourdeblue/BRelev.htm) and the
shit was officially scared out of us. We had a climb from 800ft to nearly 4000ft
ahead of us.

Yesterday's escapades had only entailed about a 2000ft gain, and *that* had
scared us into calling it an early day with only 30 miles under our belt. What
the hell was this thing going to do to us? Would I be able to walk again? Would
my heart explode on the side of this godawful mountain? Like any sensible person
of my generation, I began to tweet frantically.

Eventually, we settled up at the restaurant, picked up a few items from the
convenience store, and got back to the Parkway. The tension between the two of
us was obvious. We weren't talking much. I think we were both pretty scared; I
can certainly say I was.

Then it started. Somehow it's never as bad as you think. I think back to
Orwell's words:

> It is a feeling of relief, almost of pleasure, at knowing yourself at last
> genuinely down and out. You have talked so often of going to the dogs - and
> well, here are the dogs, and you have reached them, and you can stand it. It

Yes, it's awful. Your legs hurt, you perpetually don't think you can go any
further, sweat runs down your face, yellow-jackets circle around your head for a
nip of the Tang on your breath. But you keep your head beamed on that goddamn
5x10 block of pavement in front of you and you watch it move. And it does. And
forward you go.

It's a physical representation of something I hadn't consciously understood
until now that's a motif in life: if you want to accomplish huge things, you
don't do so by keeping your eye fixed on the end. You do one minute task at a
time until you can stand back and see progress at a macroscopic level.

I got to do so when Mike said that he would puke if we didn't take a break. So
we did. Mike said his heart was beating irregularly; I didn't say a damn thing
because I couldn't talk, and we had a nice sit on the side of a grassy hill.

After a little while, athletic-looking men and women began to pass us going up
the hill. They were on unloaded road bikes. We cheered them on from our restive
vantage point on the side of the road and they shouted encouraging things back.

Mike rallied and decided that he wanted to chase these fellow cyclists; I told
Mike he was crazy and that we'd never catch them, but we got back on the saddles
anyway.

The day for me is mostly a blur of the frantic-panting, eyes-half-closed,
forward-leaning, 60lb-wobble pumping of the legs that climbing the BRP entails.
Do it sometime: it's awesome.

Finally, we hit an intersection with the Appalachian trail, which included a
parking lot, a picnic area, an incredible overlook, and some camp-able grassy
flats.

We ogled the views awhile and then got to setting up tent. In the middle of
setting up tent, a friendly cyclist came by and informed us that we may get
kicked out of the area by park officials, since this parking lot wasn't a part
of the Jefferson national forest, but he recommended a spot two miles down (or,
more accurately, up) the road. We thanked him and dismantled our half-built
tent.

After just barely making it to the fire-road the friendly cyclist had directed
us to, we walked down the unkempt road and saw a place flat enough to set up the
tent. 

The place gave me the creeps. Very strange plant-life and quiet as could be at
near 4000 feet high.

We got tent set up and cooked beef stew. We were both in fairly foul moods after
the difficult climb and said little that wasn't laced with contempt or
condescension. Luckily, nothing got nasty; thanks again to my father for having
us kids travel enough to know the transient demons brought on by an empty
stomach and a long day.

We ate our soup, changed into sleep clothes, and set up tent. Pretty
immediately, the tent went dark and we closed our eyes for sleep. Until we heard
the human-sounding footsteps somewhere outside of our tent. 

I grabbed my knife and shut up. The only two things I could hear were those
footsteps and my heart beating about as fast as it had been earlier on the hill.
I whispered to Mike about it. We waited a few minutes and it went away; the time
was around ten and all was dark.

I fall asleep; fast-forward to 1AM. I wake up and feel something isn't right.
I'm probably just a little dehydrated. I take a hit of water and roll over.

The footsteps again.

I immediately grab my knife and listen. More footsteps. Christ.

I wait. Eventually, they die down, and I sleep for the next two hours with the
knife in my hands.

I'm not superstitious, but I have heard stories about strange things happening
while camping, and certainly my Irish relatives have a few things to say about
ethereal happenings. I will say this: near where we camped, there looked to be a
structure that had collapsed long ago that was made out of cinderblocks. I dunno
what went on in that thing, but it had a strange feeling to it.

I was glad when we got out in the morning.

The Blue Ridge Parkway exemplifies a characteristic I've seen in other awesome
presences of nature: it's extremely beautiful and completely unrelenting. By
morning, we were still exhausted.

We pulled 58 miles on Day 4, and I can still feel it.
