  
I woke up in Room 27 of the James K. Polk motel feeling the jittery ache of
fever. It was May 31st in Columbia, Tennessee. I consulted with the mirror and
saw that my eye was still red, though it had improved from the previous day.
    
Claims from the internet notwithstanding, no thieving prostitutes had visited us
in the night. If they had, they'd left me undisturbed and cleaned up after
themselves.
   
We brushed our teeth, chamois-cream'd, and put on our day clothes. After a
quick pack, we were out on the street and I was fighting the urge to clamp my
eyes shut. I returned the key to the front desk and we rolled down to get
breakfast at Shipley's Donut Factory.

We entered the empty Factory and ordered from an Asian kid wearing earbuds and
tending the shop. Who knows if the kid could hear a thing we said, but he
delivered the food we ordered. Mike and I sat in the back, munching donuts and
wondering how the hell to prepare ourselves for biking in the sauna outside.

We finished up our food and left almost immediately. Giving your stomach a few
minutes to digest a half-pound of white flour and sugar before biking a few
hours is a very good idea, but it wasn't one that occurred to us. 

We stepped out into the sweltering heat. The roar of traffic and the bright
glare made my head whirl. I felt like the used dance-floor of a Hollywood
nightclub on Sunday morning.

We pedaled on and all I could do was try to keep breakfast down. I know it
sounds like a lot of complaining (and it is), but this is the phase of the day
when I'm absolutely miserable. I have this recurring inner monologue that
includes a healthy string of obscenities, declarations of my profuse hatred for
bicycling, promises to sell the bike as soon as I hit Haight-Ashbury, and a
quick pep-talk to get ready for upchucking. There are many good reasons to do
this trip. I just can't call any of them to mind during the early afternoon.

A few miles down the road, Mike hit a flat for the second consecutive day.
We stopped by the side of a bridge and got his back tire off. Mike went to work
and I milled around looking for shade, sweat pouring out of me.

When you're biking in serious heat, you do a fair bit of sweating, but nothing
compared to volume you exude once you stop moving. If you stay in heat without
movement, you no longer have the wind cooling your sweat: like a stationary
water-skier sinking into a lake, the heat collects around you. The only response
possible is to sit, gushing sweat, or get back on the saddle.

After Mike fixed the flat, we got back on the road and went a while before
hitting a gas station in a very small town. At this point in the trip, whenever
any chance for a water-refill presents itself, we pounce. We went in
and bought two 24oz. gatorades from the young girl working the counter.

We sat drinking the gatorades and watched locals come in and out. One guy with a
big ol' country gut came in, took one look at us, and let out a "WHEEEE-WHEEW!"

We finished up the sodium water, filled up our
bottles, and kept riding.

An hour later, we hit a small town called Hohenwald that contained a McDonald's.
We ran at the golden arches like two pissed bulls at a flamboyant Spaniard and
spent the next few hours lounging in climate control and cherry-picking from the
value menu. Mike read Capote and I fought with my netbook, trying to square
Linux and Flickr's flash-based upload page.

We left the comfort of the cool haven. I dragged my feet like a grade-schooler
coming in from recess. We rode on, pumping our legs against the hills.

In a few miles, there was a large descent. We ran into a fellow bicycle tourist
named Julie. Julie said she'd just recently gotten out of Missouri and had been
ten miles outside of Joplin when it was torn to pieces by the tornado. We told
her we'd be spending a rest day in Memphis, so she told is in response that we
should hit Beale St. and find the most grungy dive we could for some brew and
music. Check.

We approached the Tennessee river, rode up to the crest of the bridge and
snapped some pictures. We were hungry by then, so we googled eateries to the
west and found a variety of places, all seafood based. Mike had wanted to try
some genuine Tennessee catfish, so we rode on to check out the Fish House Diner.
We completed the bridge and found ourselves in western Tennessee.

We branched off of 412W to find the Diner and noticed that there was an
abundance of closed shops and restaurants. We hadn't seen any movement for a
while, but we kept pedaling in the hopes of encountering live civilization and
hot food.

But that didn't happen. Every restaurant we hit was dead: dim and empty. The
streets were deserted. An abandoned grocery store sat lifeless and crumbling
across the street from the diner we'd intended to stop at.

The whole locale had a foreboding, desolate weight that kinda freaked me out.
All the marks of humanity we'd encountered so far were stations of active,
flowing commerce. This place was like a decaying mausoleum, soundlessly waiting
for us to either leave or stay and decompose.

We stopped to figure out where we could get some food. Mike said that we may end
up eating toaster pastries for the night; I said something to the tune of "hell
no." 

We started to bicker and then realized we were hungry[^1], so we wolfed a
Snickers each and then found a town called Parsons on the map.

Parsons appeared to have all the modern accoutrements we were after, so we
decided to make the ten mile hike. We'd originally intended on staying at a
campgrounds in Decaterville (the ghost-town), which left our sleeping
arrangements for the night to-be-determined from here on out.

While we wheeled out of the small town, Mike commented that this is the kind of
place in which horror movies are filmed. I agreed, then caught sight of a church
billboard that read *PRAY FOR HOLLY. GOD HEARS YOUR PRAYERS.* This message shook
me further; I didn't know who Holly was or what had happened, but it didn't
sound good. We later found out that Holly was a town girl who'd gone missing.

I snapped some pictures and we started for Parsons.

The ride to Parsons was a series of hills, which was a trying way to end
the evening. The sides of the hills were littered with empty businesses and
menacing, windowless hovels with wrecked furniture outside. I made a mental note
that, while we could camp behind these places likely without incident, I'd
rather not.

A few grueling minutes later, we got into Parsons and saw people and movement. I
felt relieved. We navigated our way to a place called Granny's Kitchen and
chained our bikes to a signpost. There were three police cruisers out front,
which spoke well for the cuisine.

We walked into the restaurant and saw that the dining area was mostly empty; 
a few tables were stirring warmly. We collapsed into some chairs and then were
approached by a brusque waitress who looked not a day over 15.

Mike settled down with a plate of deep-fried catfish and hush-puppies and I
enjoyed a plate of breaded chicken. We watched the table full of cops, wondering
if we should approach them to ask if we could camp on their station's grounds.
Mike wondered if they'd let us spend the night in a cell, then I thought back to
one of O. Henry's stories about a vagrant unsuccessfully trying to get
incarcerated for the winter.

The food took around 45 minutes to arrive: we wondered if they'd lost the
instructions to the deep-fryer until we realized that the cops topped us
on the totem pole. By the time we'd finished the food, it was dark and I was
feeling the icy trough of a fever. We decided that given the circumstances, we'd
better rest up in a motel.

I called the Parsons Inn and talked the lady on the other end down $10 (!) for
our cheapest stay yet at exactly $35. We left the restaurant to an empty parking
lot and made tracks for the Inn. My glasses had come unscrewed in the
restaurant, freeing one of the lenses, so I followed Mike as best I could
through the streets of Parsons.

Mike did his disappearing act and one signature later I had a key from the
Indian girl working the Inn counter. The place was noticeably shoddier than our
previous motel, the James K. Polk. We packed into the 8x12 box that had "103"
taped on it. 

I showered up and went to bed after downing two bottle-fulls of
water and enough Ibuprofin to treat half the Airborne division.
