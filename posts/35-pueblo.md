We awoke, surprised, in the shade. The portable storage unit that we'd camped
behind in the soccer field had shielded us from the morning sun. June 21st, La
Junta, CO. 

That day we were headed to Pueblo, where we'd be staying with Patti, a friend of
Vanessa's. Excited at the prospect of a rest-day, we packed up quickly and rode
for a fastfood place to change our clothes.

We made it, ate, and split for Pueblo.

Coming into La Junta, the terrain had taken a turn for dry and rocky. The ride
into Pueblo showed us even more of the beige, arid emptiness that we'd seen the
night previous. It felt nice to see the flavor of wilderness change again.

The ride was predictably uneventful. We passed another cow city or two and
experienced the accompanying kick of dung-scent. It was an uphill ride,
but our cadence was steady out of excitement for a few soft days of rest at
Patti's.

In the early afternoon, we hit the outskirts of Pueblo, which were fairly
desolate. We saw a turnoff for the Pueblo Chemical Dump; Mike asked if I wanted
to visit that scenic landmark. I yelled back that they must have an awesome
gift-shop.

We entered a residential area and, after a few turns, we hit Patti's
house. We dismounted, I took off my helmet, and smoothed my hair.

I didn't know what to expect; we'd been talking to Patti for months over the
internet, albeit sparsely, and she'd been following our trip since the
beginning. This was the first time I'd be hearing her voice, let alone meeting
her in person. I was piqued.

We walked through the front door and saw a slender girl with chestnut-brown
hair, which was shoulder-length and had subtle, light streaks. I said hi and she
welcomed us nonchalantly in a warm, calm voice like finished rosewood.  She
showed us the downstairs that we'd be annexing for the next few days.

The house was clean and relatively spacious. Art made by friends was scattered
around the middle level of the house with a few primary pieces featured in the
living room.

Mike and I took showers simultaneously (there's a new trick) in two different
bathrooms. I finished washing, slipped my mesh shorts on, and padded down the
stairs to talk to Patti. I stood on one side of the kitchen counter while Patti
stood across from me on the other side, making guacamole. We traded questions,
both answering coyly, while she traversed the kitchen making other preparations
for the barbecue to be held tonight in honor of us crazies[^1].

Mike joined us after finishing his shower and, characteristically, went right to
work on Patti's roof trying to fix the air-conditioner. Patti and I sat
on her shady porch after helping Mike ascend the ladder to the roof. We
talked leisurely and I looked her over like a tipsy detective studying the femme
fatale.

After Mike yelled down from the roof, signifying that he hadn't died, we
steadied the ladder once again and he alighted from the roof.

Mike again at ground-level, we decided to go on a beer run. Patti
gave us directions to a liquor store that she couldn't identify by name but told
us it'd be next to a pet grooming place named K9-Cutters on Norwood. We met
Patti's roommate, Lisa, and promptly thereafter were given keys to her car for
the beer run.

I jumped at the keys. Since Mike is weary of automatic transmissions, the rare
privilege of driving a car wasn't something we had to rock-paper-scissors
for[^2]. We hopped into Lisa's white Dodge and were off[^3].

The reduced field of vision hit me as soon as I landed in the driver's seat.
Going from 2000 contiguous miles on a bike to a short ride down the street in a
car is like going from a go-kart to the Millennium Falcon. I went at a
snail's pace down the road, looking around neurotically in wait for a family
of five to jump onto the hood of the Dodge.

A few long minutes later, we got to the liquor store and negotiated the
lethargic Asian teenager working the counter. Another round of white-knuckled
Oregon Trail later and we were back at Patti's with a fair amount of beer[^4].

We sat out with Patti on the porch, talking pleasant miscellany and enjoying our
new home, however temporary. Patti queued up *Rome*, which is a collaboration
between producer Dangermouse and some Italian spaghetti-Western composer, on her
vintage stereo. She only dug the songs that featured Jack White. 

The drinking began and guests started to show. The first round of arrivals were
a group of three: Randy, Andy, and Alan[^5]. Randy and Andy were a couple: Randy
a lively girl of copper complexion and Andy a native-Coloradan welder with an
Illinois accent.  Alan was heavy-set and initially very quiet, although he
turned out to be well-educated and good for talk.

Patti began grilling and we mingled with guests. Gabriel, an artist and a friend
of Patti's, showed up and we talked about working shitty jobs to build
character and grinding lucrative careers to fund explorations into less secure
lives. Gabriel was polite and friendly and a pleasure to speak to.

John, a publisher, showed up. John was witty and bearded: he told me about the
tribulations necessary to properly format a book of poetry in Amazon's MOBI
markup.  I cornered him for his opinion on Oxford commas[^6] and Randy jumped
in, emphatically agreeing that the commas are necessary to resolve ambiguity. We
high-fived and went through all the congratulatory rigmarole of meeting someone
with grammatical competence.

We moved the discussion outside, where Alan jumped in and argued that the comma
is "superfluous."[^7] The conversation then progressed into language and
economics and about 10 other subjects that I can bluff through but have
little-to-no formal training in. 

The tablewide conversation then took a turn for the topics of prostitution and
erotic dancing. One girl, whose name I don't remember, told us that she had
taken her boyfriend to Vegas and ended up with a $700 tab for a lapdance she
didn't order. We talked at length about that.

Andy then told a lewd story that everyone laughed at. The story is in the
footnotes because I'm sure not all readers will appreciate its vulgarity.[^9]

The backyard darkened and mosquitoes antagonized the majority of us, so
we moved the party inside. After a few rounds of Apples to Apples, Randy, Andy,
and Alan split; John followed suit soon afterwards.

Guests slowly and evenly tapered as the clock worked.

The end of the evening had Patti, Mike, and I sitting in the living room.
Patti and I did the conversing as Mike stared into space. 

Patti sat in an armchair and I sat on the floor facing her and asking questions.
I told her she had beautiful feet[^11] and I had a strong compulsion to hold her
but restrained because this isn't the Paleolithic and you can't simply hit a
woman over the head and drag her into intimacy.

Mike and I forced our stiff legs down the stairwell and we fell asleep in the
basement, Mike on a collection of pillows and me on a couch. A surplus of
guacamole and beer was left in the fridge.

[^1]: and the summer solstice, but who cares about weather when you've got
lunatics

[^2]: or more realistically, roshambo for

[^3]: Mike will tell you that I almost got into an accident reversing out
of Patti's driveway. This isn't *quite* the case: Mike alerted me to a truck
coming down the road, approximately seventy feet away. I woulda caught it. Probably.

[^4]: after a case of High Life and a box of Franzia had gone uninjured at our
going away party, we've learned to temper our preparatory buys.

[^5]: begging for a sitcom? maybe a song-and-dance trio?

[^6]: I do this to everyone I meet who has a responsibility to know English
especially well. I'm set in one particular argument (the commas are necessary)
but I do it for fun anyway. 

[^7]: pfffffffft.

[^8]: forget her name

[^9]: A friend of Andy's brought home a stripper and her boyfriend to his
apartment. The stripper and boyfriend immediately began screwing violently on
the poor kid's couch with an innocent, awkward bystander betwixt. Another
roommate walked in from work. The shocked entrant screamed, "GET YOUR CUNT OFF
MY COUCH!" and began beating the stripper.[^10]

[^10]: Dollars to donuts that every one of you read that footnote.

[^11]: which she does; they are small and sculpted with gradual, even curves.
