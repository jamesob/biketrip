We awoke to our alarms akimbo in the still-dark, dingy motel room in Bean
Station[^1]. After five minutes or so, we were wolfing cold pizza that we had
ordered the night prior. We made short work of four slices, then got to packing
quickly.  We are pretty sure that the Good 'Ol Boys are running some kind of
shady prostitution ring out of the Bean Station Budget Inn, so we wasted no time
in packing up and hitting the road for Knoxville.

After Mike returned the key to the woman stationed at the front desk, we were off.
The morning was extremely overcast, humid, and slightly breezy. My kind of
weather.

The day started on flat terrain, which our legs appreciated. I put on some
music[^2] to amplify the feeling I got from the desolate, fragrant, and wet
environment. The plant-life surrounding us was lush from a recent watering and
matte from lack of morning sun. We pedaled on, and I greatly
enjoyed the mood. Think Tennessee impersonating the state of Washington.

Eventually the sky sprung a leak and in five minutes we were getting showered on
(good imitation). It didn't matter much; we clothed in water-proof tops and kept
trucking. If anything, the rainfall added to the atmosphere.

After stopping at a gas station, we huddled under an awning for a while and the
dumping stopped. We ditched the rain clothes and kept pedaling.

We rode through a valley, funneled by green hills. The recent rain had anointed
the tops of the hills with mist. The fog gave an even more surreal tint to the
Washington look. We were sitting pretty in a bike lane.

We banged out 41 miles, then we reached the outskirts of Knoxville.
Our first item of the day was to visit a Walmart and stock up on all of the
cheap goodies to which we had become accustomed. We made the few turns necessary
and wound up in the sort of massive parking lot that signals a hallowed ground
of voluminous commerce.

Before shopping, we went to the McDonald's and got stuffed on McDoubles,
sundaes, pies, fries, etc. I think we're finally getting a little tired of the
value menu, but time will tell.

We locked bikes in the Walmart parking lot and got to shopping after Mike left
his mark on the bathroom. We finished browsing, then tallied and paid at the
register. We forgot to pick up apple sauce. Bummer.

After Walmart, we scouted out a bike shop on the cell phones and set out towards
that. This took us closer into Knoxville, where the hills came alive and beat
the hell out of our knees. After descending a monster hill, we hit a left on
Broadway and found the bike place, Greenlee.

When we walked into the bike shop, the mechanics on duty stared at us with a
mixture of wonder and lethargy. I yelled something about spokes and they got to
measuring my wheels. The mechanic who was working with me had a handlebar
mustache and I'm sure he was very excited to work around the heavy panniers
hanging off the side of my bike. In fact, I know he was very excited based on
the swears coming out of the side of his mouth as he pushed and pulled to get to
the wheel's quick-release.

Nonetheless, he did a great job measuring the spokes and only charged me four
bucks for four of them. Mike was talking to another, slightly more sunny
mechanic and got a few bolts replaced on his front rack. We left the bike shop
happy, especially considering we had entered the bike shop with no spokes
compatible with my bike.

We kept trucking down broad, entered downtown Knoxville, and found a coffee shop
to unwind at. A very swanky coffee shop.

We did our standard
hey-I'm-just-a-cyclist-walking-into-your-shop-surreptitiously-with-a-5-lb-bag-of-electronics-chargers[^3]
stroll past the register and found some comfy couches. I ordered an iced coffee
and Mike got his signature sweet-tea/lemon-bar combo which seemed to do him
pretty well.

The coffee shop, as I said, really was swanky. The bar itself was beneath a
little structure within the shop that you could actually access via a set of
stairs. A lattice of small, soft lights on the bottom of this structure kept the
bar well lit.

We hung here for a few hours. Instead of writing an update like a good bicycle
tourist, I recharged my batteries by browsing the typical fare I would were I at
home, i.e. hackernews. After an hour and a half, I was knee deep in an article
that provided yet another fix to all time management problems ever, and Mike was
tired of waiting around. Mike said he was going to go bike around and try to
find some postcards; we decided that he'd come back here and we'd call up our
host for the night, Don Fritz.

Mike went and came, then we tried calling Don. No answer! We decided that we'd
better cruise on over to his place to see what was up with our sleeping
arrangements for the evening. We hopped on our bikes and pedaled southeast, into
the heart of the UTenn campus.

On the way over, we met a very relaxed, middle-aged black guy[^4] tooling around
on a bike. He asked about our gear and said he was going to a brew pub just down
the street. On the way, about three people recognized him, one of whom called
our new friend "handsome." We said we'd make it to the bar if we could, but
unfortunately never did.

After a few more minutes of pedaling, we made it to Don's house. We'd caught Don
unexpected (like the inexperienced surfers we were), but no less, he welcomed us
in. We asked him if he'd like to join us out to eat and he accepted. I could see
that he'd prepared for our arrival: there were pillows, blankets, and a
roll-away bed set up in the middle of Don's living room.

Don put on a Janis Joplin tye-dyed t-shirt (more on her in a little) and got out
his mountain bike, which had a trailer attached for grocery runs. We set off for
Biscuit st., where a cluster of restaurants were circled around an upscale
pedestrian area. We chose one almost at random and shared a delicious meal, Mike
getting a Ruban and Don and I getting hamburgers. Over dinner, Don told us about
himself and his interests, which consist almost entirely of Janis Joplin and
researching his extended family, which, of course, includes Janis.
                                                                                   
We finished up with the meal and returned to where we parked our bikes, slightly
unsure of what to do next. Eventually, Don proposed we go to see the Sun Sphere,
which is a monument that was built for the year that Knoxville hosted the
World's Fair. As we walked towards the Sphere, Don told us a lot more about his
extended family, which allegedly includes Michael Jackson, Mohammed Ali, Katie
Couric, the Arquettes, and the Duff girls. How all this is possible, I am not
sure, but Don seems to have done a lot of research.

We got to the Sun Sphere and took an elevator up. It was eerily deserted, but we
got a great view of Knoxville and Don told us a little bit about very many
prominent buildings. Don snapped some pictures, then we began the walk back to
the bikes.

Again we arrived at the bikes and again we were at a loss as to what to do next.
The time was only around eight, relatively early for a Friday night, but then
again Mike and I were pretty beat from our ride in. Don suggested we got to see
one of the oldest cemeteries in the city which was only a few blocks away; Mike
and I happily agreed.

After the cemetery, we went back to Don's place and talked more about his family
and Janis. Don claims he has a spiritual connection with Janis because he
discovered her name in his research without any context for who she was and felt
impelled to learn more about her. In this way, he became one of Janis Joplin's
biggest fans.

Don's living room is an impressive array of all of the family-related
memorabilia he has collected, with a preference towards Janis. Hundreds of
knick-knacks fill the room, each with a significance, a connection, or a story
somehow linking the object back to Don's family. 

What drives a man to research his family so obsessively I'm not sure. But I do
admire Don's zeal and he's a damn interesting guy to spend a few hours with.

After watching a few songs from a Joplin DVD, I told Don I was ready to turn in,
so he got out some blankets and bid us good night. I fell asleep almost
instantaneously: whoever knocks couches for sleep-comfort isn't trying the right
furniture.
