I don't have time to do a full update for Day 6, so here's a Best Of:

<ul>
	<li><p>Short ride from Roanoke into Blacksburg up some damn steep mountain
	roads. Passed a patch of donkeys in a valley. I yelled "EEYORE!" more times
	than I'd like to admit.</p></li>

	<li><p>Took my bike into a shop, Hokie Spokes, which I highly recommend. I
	just wanted to use the guy's table vice to get my freewheel off, but he
	ended up truing my wheel (after banging on it with both a rubber mallet and
	a hammer) and replacing a spoke nipple and tube. A few times I questioned
	his handy-work and all times I got back responses like, "yeah, we can do it
	that way if you want to half-ass it," and, "look, man, I don't <i>have</i>
	to do this for you." His name is Dave and we ended up getting along well. I
	liked his honest demeanor and he did damn good work for a reasonable
	price.</p></li>

	<li><p>Met up with our good friend Sam, who had slept four hours in the past
	three days. He took us to a gyro bar where we were served greasy, delicious
	lamb by a girl wearing shorts that said "HOO-AH" on the bum. She looked like
	she could break your arm and then apologize for it afterwards.</p></li>

	<li><p>Returned to Sam's place, raided his fridge. We retooled and repacked,
	dropping around forty pounds in frivolous weight. Some items abandoned
	were</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Soy sauce in an 8oz glass bottle</li>
		<li>boombox</li>
		<li>cast-iron pans</li>
		<li>logic and languages text</li>
		<li>onion</li>
		<li>skippy peanut butter jar (creamy)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I adjusted my rear derailleur and saddle. The trip is now about three times
	easier.</p></li>

	<li><p>Ordered pizza and watched TV with Sam and friends, which was very
	relaxing.</p></li>

	<li><p>Conked on Sam's floor. Slept like a toddler at church.</p></li>
</ul>
