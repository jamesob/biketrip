I woke up in Mark's basement in a king-size bed. I remember feeling immediate
distress at the idea of leaving that bed.

Mike walked in the door and said, "better get up. It's going to be a hard day."

"Headwinds?"

"Headwinds. Both our rear tires are flat."

I propped myself up and looked around. Light from the open door streamed into
the otherwise dim room. That kind of light always gets me up.

I brushed teeth, dropped contacts in, and put the bike clothes on. I found Mike
and Mark in the front yard with the bikes splayed out in the grass.

We found our respective leaks and patched them while Leanna ran out the door to
go off to a medical certification class. After the flats were treated, the
three of us went back inside for some cereal and a long, hard look at the
weather report for the day.

Mike and Mark poured over wind maps while I enjoyed a cup of coffee. 
The good sleep, pleasant company, and hot coffee made me feel new.
We relaxed at Mark's kitchen table for a while, savoring
the last few minutes of a morning spent indoors.

We thanked, waved, left, and were pedaling west of Wichita before too long.

A
few miles down Maple Avenue, the road had been blocked off and, beyond the
orange and white traffic signs, was completely demolished. Clods of uneven dirt
were in place of pavement.

We didn't feel like turning around, so we walked our bikes onto the side of the
road and then through the wreckage. Large machines drove around us. We
walked ten feet in front of some foreman and a lackey who were talking, but they
didn't acknowledge us.

We cleared the construction area and made around ten miles down 54. We watched
the dark pastel colors in the sky to the northwest. Every now and again we
caught veins of lightening running through the big clouds. I kept my eye on the
faraway storm while I pedaled. I wondered about the little cluster of farmhouses
below that angry sky.

By then we had a nice tailwind boosting us through the plains. We were cruising.
Before then, I had thought that a good tailwind made you feel as though you are
biking through a vacuum, simply compensating for the air you move in front of
you for a zero-sum. Then, I realized that a serious tailwind can actually be
felt propelling you forwards, which is slightly scary but undoubtedly awesome.

The sky above us got darker. That made me kind of giddy.

Since the wind, our tailwind, was blowing southwest, it was a reasonable
assumption that the storm was moving our way. We heard thunder and traces of
rain began to fall around us.  The wind got more and more fierce.

The daylight had nearly vanished now and we were left alone with the highway and
the trucks and the looming clouds above us.

Ahead of us, we could see a large volume of dust being picked up by the wind and
moved from farmland into the middle of the road. I wondered about tornado
warnings but managed to stay giddy. Cold gusts hit us, which was refreshing but
threatening.

A mile later, we came to a concrete overpass. The wind was really roaring now
and the tunneling of the overpass made the effect even more dramatic. We stopped
on the shoulder under the overpass and I had to hold my bike in place to keep it
from moving forward.

I ripped open Food Bag 2 and ate a reconstituted Snickers in around 20 seconds
after throwing Mike one.

We talked about our concern with the weather. We checked the forecast: no
tornado warnings, but a few for severe thunderstorms. We briefly considered
taking shelter in a ditch under the overpass, but then decided that this was the
tailwind of our lives[^1] and that the skies to the west looked clear. Mike
donned his rain-jacket but I figured hell with it after stashing the camera in a
pannier. We mounted the saddles and tore pavement in the mid-twenties
of MPH. 

After pockets of rain, skies cleared up and we somehow came out of the storm
with the tailwind intact. We rode that sucker all the way to lunch. On the way
to the McDonald's, we spotted a beautiful earth-sheltered house that was built
into the side of a hill.

We ate the typical value-menu slew for lunch. In between bites, I looked at a
few of the local girls with a little lasciviousness but mostly just out of
curiosity. We called our CouchSurfing host for the night, Gene, and told him we
were around 30 miles outside of town and would be in around 6PM. 

We rode a weakened but still considerable tailwind into Pratt and admired the
small town. The streets of its downtown were undergoing an upgrade from brick to
pavement, so we wheeled along the sidewalk and caught sight of things like
coffeeshops and a movie theater. I liked Pratt instantly: it made me feel
nostalgic for the small-town America I'd never experienced but had seen in
movies.

We pulled up to the Messick house, just a few blocks from downtown. Gene, Megan,
and some of the kids were standing out front and greeted us as we rode in. We
got hearty handshakes from each, then Gene's friend Nick walked up and
introduced himself.

The Messick property actually has three small houses on the grounds clustered
very closely together. Gene, Megan, and the kids live in one, Nick lives in the
other, and the third is used as storage. Mike and I, after being charmed by the
folks and the town, were drawn immediately to the possibility of fixing the
place up and calling it home for a while[^2].

Each house is almost a miniature, but they're all very cosy. The Messick house
proper, especially, is well decorated and efficiently organized.

Within half an hour, we were drinking beer and grilling chicken. Gene, Megan,
Mike, Nick, and I stood outside in the pre-storm weather talking and drinking
and grilling. I looked at the portion of downtown I could see from their
property.

Nick and Gene met in the navy and have been close friends ever since. Gene is
originally from Texas, and met Megan while stationed in Washington state, where
Megan grew up[^3]. We learned all of this while watching in awe as the grill
remained on fire even after we'd disconnected the propane tank.

Rain had been sprinkling and finally the chicken finished, so we grabbed the
tray of cooked meat and brought it inside.

Many beers and a lot of eating followed.

At one point in the night, standing in the doorway of the kitchen, I told Gene
that he had a young, beautiful American family. Gene and Megan demonstrated to
me a way of life that I hadn't seen before. They're a young couple with a cool
house in a storybook town and they go at child-rearing with an incredible,
casual energy that seems available only to those in their twenties. Their family
is their life's work, and it shows.

Both Gene and Megan hold down jobs, though they've rigged the schedule so that
the kids are never alone. Should the kids ever need care, Nick is at home
fifteen feet away. Gene works as an inventory manager at Walmart[^4].

Their kids are all well-behaved and very sharp. Kierra made two pictures for
Mike and me after answering a few math questions. She said she loves math, which
of course made suckers out of the both of us.

The beer-drinking went on until about 1AM and, after more than a few
profanity-inspiring rounds of MarioKart, Mike and I collapsed on neighboring
couches.

[^1]: however short
[^2]: pipe dream

[^3]: very coincidentally, Megan is from Everett, WA, the same town Mary Jean
Jordan is from, and Gene, like John Jordan, was in the navy when the couple met.
Wild, huh?

[^4]: and loves the profit-sharing scheme that Walmart features for its
employees --- maybe one of the reasons the company is such a success?
