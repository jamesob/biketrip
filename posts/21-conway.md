We woke up Tuesday, June 7th, to McCrae's small-town morning heat. As is typical,
Mike got up before I did and, though I heard him rustling around the tent, I
rolled over, shut my eyes, and told myself to keep sleeping. The heat has a way
of discouraging that.
                        
No reason to rush, though. We had an easy day ahead: only 35 miles to Conway.
Sometimes we inevitably have short days because of the locations of willing
CouchSurfer hosts. After the 95 the day beforehand, we welcomed a lazy morning.

We decided to let the tent stand awhile to let the morning sun dry away the dew.
We walked over to the convenience store, banking on quaint McCrae not to steal
or vandalize our camping gear.

We sat at our table in the store, practicing our usual pastimes, Mike at Jack
and me at rabbit. I sipped a hot, black coffee drawn from an industrial-sized
pot.

After we'd both used the facilities to clean up, we went back to the tent and
disassembled. Before getting out of town, we wanted to drop by City Hall to
thank Pam, grab a picture, and use their assuredly cleaner facilities to change
into the bike gear.

We wheeled to City Hall, meeting some guys in a pickup truck outside the Hall
who were familiar with our story. Apparently, a good portion of the town was
keeping tabs on us. I guess when you live in a town of 600, unkempt
cross-country bikers are a hot rhubarb.

When we went into the small building, Pam generously offered us the bathroom to
wash up and do whatever else. The bathroom was attached to the town's courtroom,
which we found incongruously formal and therefore very entertaining. We changed
and filled our water-bottles and I should've hit Mike with the gavel but didn't.

We got a picture with Pam, that sweet woman, and another gal from the office,
then were on our way.

The ride was uneventful; I don't remember any of it.

I do remember getting into the McDonald's around lunchtime, which was adjoined
with a Shell station, because our roosting there was contingent on the presence
of a power outlet available for use. I had to search the place high and low[^1]
after Mike had come back saying the well was dry, eventually finding a hanging
extension cord snaked behind a gambling machine of some sort. The ladies at the
register told us to have at it, so we set up shop for a few hours there.
                             
We split from the McShell headed for the outskirts of Conway, where our host
Samantha and her boyfriend expected us at 6PM. We pulled into their neighborhood
looking like Mormon missions in a Blondie video, timidly unsure of the house
we'd be knocking on. Luckily, Richard and Samantha stepped out of a front door
and welcomed us onto their property.

We took the bikes into the backyard and locked them into Richard's shed,
afterwards stepping into the climate-controlled comfort of their home.

Mike and I chatted with Samantha and Richard and showered alternately, as has
become the routine on arrival to a CouchSurfing host's place. We learned that
Samantha (and, by association, Richard) were planning to go live in the
uninhabited rainforest for a year carrying only a machete and a fire-kit, which
I thought was crazier than a shithouse rat[^2], but it sure made for interesting
conversation.

Samantha and Richard had a very entertaining dynamic that I've noticed trends
with successful couples: Richard would often give Samantha a hard time in good
humor. He'd play counterpoint to most any stance she'd take. Mary Jean and John
Jordon had a similar way of rustling the other's feathers. 

These lightweight disagreements create a healthy, playful tension between any
two people, especially a couple. Perpetual agreement is boring and who the hell
wants it soft all the time anyway?

Samantha whipped up a delicious meal of chicken and pasta. Mike and I sailed
through our plates while S&R told us about Samantha's trip to Italy, her stay in
Miami studying various tattoo artists, and a spontaneous vacation the two had
taken to New Mexico, sleeping in cars and exploring caverns.

After the table had been cleared of food, the four of us sat in the living room,
each using a computer in some way. Samantha, Richard, and I all sat on one
couch.  I half-mindedly recaptured the route for the day in GMaps while joining
Richard in wisecracking on the object of Sam's pastime: Sex and the City 2. Sam
listened to the movie through earbuds while we tried to figure out what in gods
name the dumb bimbos were doing, *sans* sound.

After a few sweet minutes of this, Mike and I dropped hints indicating we
were ready to lay a headstone on the day, which Richard immediately picked up
on. Before we even had the electronics tucked in, Richard had laid out enough
sleeping material to suffocate a small elephant. We dug in and let the couches
anesthetize our senses away.

pavement, chased by 10-ton trucks, and surrounded by pungent, dead animals.
