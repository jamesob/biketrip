*In the weeks after I stopped this trip, I found it arduous to even consider
rehashing the events leading up to our arrival in San Francisco. The deep gash
torn in my senses by such an experience was fresh and the wound still painful to
revisit; I would often become overwhelmed trying to reenter at any specific day,
the composite of the summer almost immediately rushing in and toppling my
thought.

I find now, after settling into a more stable and conventional life, that the
content of unrelated, every-day conversation often makes me flash back to this
summer. It makes me yearn, like nothing I've ever wanted before, to be back
on the road with the bikes and Mike.

Welcome to season two. This leg of my journal will be more spartan and will
serve purely to complete the story. I will try to convey all the detail I can
remember.*

I awoke a mile south of Westcliffe to light streaming through the thin fabric of
the tent. Outside the tent, the green base of Rocky mountains lurked a few
thousand feet away from our small island of trees and loose rock. I zipped open
the tent and, with great effort, positioned my feet onto the floor of small
rocks below.

We had used Mike's bike cover to shield the electrical outlet from any rain,
giving us a charging station for our gadgetry. I checked that there wasn't
any damage to my phone or laptop, then walked to the bathroom with my hygiene
gear in tow.

After Mike and I cleaned up and dressed, we exchanged a groggy good-morning with
John and his wife[^1]. John urged us to take something called he called the
Cotopaxi shortcut, which ended up being the hypotenuse of a triangle with 69
(the road out of Westcliffe) and 50 (the road to Salida) as the legs. This would
save us roughly 15 miles, so we were thankful for the tip.

Last night, we had rigged a makeshift umbrella centered around the wooden post
that housed electrical outlets on our campsite. This was so we could charge all
of our gear during the night and have some protection against it getting wet. I
checked the electronics to make sure they were okay and packed them away. Mike
and I packed up the tent, I said one last goodbye to the campground's plush
restrooms, and we got on the road for a breakfast in Westcliffe proper.
