My legs were bent at the knee when I woke up on Patti's downstairs couch. Day 
36, June 22nd, Pueblo, CO.

Mike had been stirring for sometime and I had listened to the sounds of his
motion in a half-daze. After a few minutes, I rose and dropped my contacts in,
regaining mid- and long-distance vision.

I sauntered to the upstairs and took stock of the midlevel. Nobody up. I didn't
need to check the garage because I knew by hunch that Mike was in it working
on our bikes.

Patti passed in and out of the kitchen quickly wearing a blue bathrobe. Her
brown hair was dark and weighted with water. I might've taken a picture, but
then she might've smacked me.

I lingered in the kitchen awhile and eventually Lisa showed up looking for
coffee. I voiced sympathy and so we made plans to meet Patti at a coffeeshop in
downtown Pueblo. Mike wandered in from the garage and the three of us piled into
Lisa's white Dodge[^1] and drove downtown listening to The B-52's and Blondie.
We passed a huge, modern-looking library that looked great for lounging.

We arrived at the coffeeshop, a place called The Daily Grind, after Lisa had
taken a scenic drive around Pueblo. Mike ordered a breakfast burrito and I did
the same, supplementing with a hot coffee.

We took a wireframe table outside and our food was delivered. Up came Patti,
touching feet to pavement casually as Mike and I gorged. Patti took a seat and
we watched cops on horses and ate breakfast.

Patti ordered a burrito and had eaten about a tenth of it by the time Mike and I
were through with ours. After breakfast was done and the coffee finished, we
returned our dishes to the coffeeshop and left.

Patti took us on a stroll down the street and she ran into friends, Inaiah and
Mo. They sat perched outside a graphic design studio. Mike and I got acquainted
with both and found out that Mo owned the shop. I quickly got talking with Mo
about his business. We were invited inside and went.

Mo told us about how he had inadvertently gotten into the graphic design
business and had opened the shop's doors with $100 in his bank account. His
two-man firm had gone on to design a variety of posters and brands for bands and
events around the country, hearing only of Mo's firm by word-of-mouth.

We said goodbye to the two artists and walked to Patti's black Honda. She drove
us to a bike shop, The Great Divide, along the way pointing out an automotive
service center turned bar owned by a friend of hers. We arrived at the bike-shop
and purchased tubes after meandering around a little.

We drove back to Patti's, sat her barely-touched burrito in the fridge, and
split for Red Rock Open Space, just outside of Colorado Springs. We planned to
meet Josh Snyder, our rambunctious friend from the GMU math department now
stationed in UC Boulder's applied math.

Patti guided the Honda out of Pueblo and onto I-25; we blew threw the arid dust
surrounding the interstate and I gaped at the mountains to our left, snapping
photos and videos in peak tourist form. The snow-capped Almagres loomed to the
east, Pike's Peak jutting up stoically into the blue afternoon sky. The roadside
environment fluctuated wildly between greenery and sandy beige.

Patti played music over the stereo from a Colorado Springs-native musician whom
she knows. The songs were soft arrangements that amplified the loneliness of the
mountainous desert around us. I looked out the window at the surreal landscape
and asked Patti if she'd ever gotten used to seeing mountains like these. She
said she had.

In under an hour, we made it to the outskirts of Springs. Patti landed the car
in the parking lot of Red Rock Open Space, an old quarry that had been donated
by the owner to the county under the condition that it remain an open space. We
opened the doors and stepped out into the dry heat. Within the first few steps,
my flip-flopped feet had a coating of sand.

Since Josh, our math buddy, wasn't yet in the area, we decided to take a walk
around the Red Rock. We stared at a trail map for a while. Mike wanted to walk
something called The Contemplative Trail, which was rated as difficult. I told
him I'd give him something to contemplate.

We began to meander into the park and down one of the trails that Patti takes
often. We saw a sign that fiercely prohibited "Rock Scrambling" and so for the
rest of the walk I was sure to remind Mike frequently that he couldn't do *any*
Rock Scrambling whatsoever, despite the burning inclinations he undoubtedly had.

Finally, Mike received a call from Josh, who'd arrived at the Garden of the
Gods, a park just down the street, so we returned to the car.

After some driving and wandering through the Garden of the Gods' gift shop and
parking lot, we found Josh. I gave him a big hug; it'd been a year or so once
we'd seen one another. Josh was a founding Fustilarian in the GMU math
department[^2] and he remains a good friend of mine, so I was happy to see him.
He immediately started in with his brand of outrageously boisterous humor and
had us in stitches.

	<div class="imageCaption">

	</div>
</div>
     
The three of us were hungry after the walk around Red Rock and so we
commandeered Josh and his incredibly-clean Honda to take us to a barbecue place
nearby.  We all ordered sandwiches and deserts in large quantity; we ended
up coaxing each other into bites out of a vat of peach cobbler in an attempt to
finish it off. A notoriously "homely" buttermilk pie went almost untouched.

We finished off lunch and went back to Garden of the Gods to walk around the
monolithic red rocks. Patti and I were more or less bored of the rocks and were
gunning for a turn-around to crawl local breweries, but Josh's company and our
recollecting of the GMU days led us to one particular rock face where climbers
were ascending the harsh, steep stone.

	<div class="imageCaption">
		What a lunatic.
	</div>
</div>
     
We watched them, fascinated, for a while and made comments ranging in timbre from
wonderstruck to irreverent. At one point, a climber was making a transition from
one rock face to a much-steeper sheet above it. In order to do this, he had to
spread-eagle himself on the face of the rock, hugging the face with legs spread.

The guy was obviously struggling (it was a tough sell), and made a few attempts,
each time returning to this awkward position. I noted that if he happened to pop
a boner, he was dead meat. Josh responded, "that would certainly put him between
a rock and a hard place."

We finished up at the Garden of the Gods after taking a band photo beside "the
balanced rock." We watched tourists come and go. Patti tried to scramble a rock
but found no good route.

After Garden of the Gods, we went into Springs proper and Patti led us around to
local breweries. Josh took Mike in his car and I rode with Patti. She played
indie cowgirl music as we talked, stuff like Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic
Zeros, and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.

We stopped at a few places, notably Bristol Brewing Company and ultimately
Trinity Brewing. Josh doesn't like beer but Mike and I do (emphatically), so we
kept trying to force our tastes on the kid. He played along, providing hilarious
responses to timid sips, eventually describing one IPA as "what you get when you
take the strings off of bananas and grind them up into a juice. Disgusting."

As we sat in Trinity, Patti ran into some friends: Seth and another guy whose
name I don't remember. Seth was a wiry, animated guy who looked to be in his
early-thirties. 

After a few drinks in Trinity, we decided to get a growler of beer and go up to
visit Lisa, a friend of Patti and Seth's, in her house nearby. We gained a few
hundred feet of elevation and found ourselves outside of a large house on an
incline. We walked into the spacious house and met Lisa, a bubbly and welcoming
blonde. We sat on her back deck for an hour or two watching dark fall on
Springs, which was spread out below us. 

I talked with Seth awhile about a business plan he had to utilize abandoned
urban areas to grow boutique vegetation for local, upscale restaurants using
hydroponics. The plots would be mobile so that whenever a given area was bought
for development, the crops could be moved easily. 

This, of course, led into a conversation about politics which ended up being
involved and rewarding. Seth was in the corner of big government, so of course
we had a lot to talk about. 

You can't ever expect to change anyone in a political discussion at dusk on
someone's deck, but you can usually expect to have your reasoning prodded, which
causes self-examination. We traded point for point and I think we both came away
with some new insight[^3][^4].

	<div class="imageCaption">
		Night fell and the city lights radiated below us.
	</div>
</div>

Seth got to talking about the local bike polo league and Mike bludgeoned him
with questions, all of which Seth was more than happy to field in his eloquent
way of firehosing the conversation with information. We promised to show up to a
game tomorrow. Mike was excited.

Patti shuffled us off of the deck and out of the house, onto our next
appointment: a writer that Patti had just met wanted to interview us. She'd told
us at lunch that about all she knew about this guy was that he was a
mostly-academic writer and wrote about the effect of medium on
communication[^5]. The only other thing she knew was that he had gone to Sweden
for a conference and had missed his own talk to drink liquor and watch porn in
his hotel room. Mike and I were both morbidly curious, so Patti, Josh, Mike, and
I split back to the Trinity parking lot to drop Josh off at his car.

We arrived at the parking lot and said goodbye to Josh. He gave us a giant paper
bag of backed goodies for use on the road. He drove away in his SRV and the
remaining three of us hopped into Patti's Honda.  She guided us through dark
roads and into the quiet streets of Manitou.

We parked in an empty street full of soft light and wandered down an alley to a
wine bar, where the writer was allegedly waiting for us.

	<div class="imageCaption">

	</div>
</div>

We walked into the wine bar, taking our steps with uncertainty, to find a
lavish, European interior that looked like the setting of one of Van Gogh's wet
dreams. Slow, cool trip-hop[^6] dripped from the bar's stereo and bathed the
scene in bluesy sophistication. Five or six people were seated at the bar. My
first thought was that a few drinks here would blow a day's food budget in very
short order.

We walked up to the bar and found Dave, the writer, and an artist friend of
Patti's. Patti introduced us to both and began talking to the two. Mike and I
looked on as Dave and the other guy dipped into an expensive-looking cheese
plate. In tie-dye and shorts, we were way out of our element.
    
Nonetheless, Dave ordered us all a round of Estonian beers that were probably
fermenting while I was incubating and asked us questions. Patti left with the
other artist to recover a desert from his fridge, a few blocks away.

	<div class="imageCaption">

	</div>
</div>

After the typical round of questions about the trip petered out, I began to ask
Dave questions and we moved from the bar to couches a few feet away.

Dave was slightly squity-eyed and looked to be in his early '40s. He was born in
Kentucky and had oscillated between there and Colorado over the years, working
academic gigs. He is finishing a book called *The Funeral Must Go On*, a black
comedy. I asked him if he could recommend me a book and he responded with *Zen
and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*[^7].

Dave ordered another round of the Estonian fare and we sat talking about
Bukowski and writing until a new, sort of cozy woman appeared at the bar, whom
Dave gravitated towards immediately. I'm not sure if he was running game or just
making friendly conversation, but it looked like the former. Mike was perched on
the couch opposite me, leisurely dazing.

I approached the bar to return Dave's favor with another round and heard Dave
make a stab at the woman's phone number. With some hurried conversational
positioning, she escaped without giving Dave her contact info ("I'll get your
number through a friend," she says). 

Patti returned and so the two of us sat on a couch, watching Mike do a
glassy-eyed, mental walk of The Contemplation Trail and Dave socialize with the
only other couple remaining at the bar.

The two of us enjoyed the arcane '80s hits[^8] that played over the stereo. We
watched the bartender, a man we later found out was named Max, tear jokes out
from under the couple he was playing Trivial Pursuit with. Max seemed like a
cool drama kid; he had mutton-chops, was slightly pudgy but wore the weight
well, and donned plaid. He had a clear, fast, loud voice that demands laughter
and he came across as worldly and tough. 

He had great taste in music; Patti and I called out guesses as new tracks
streamed over the stereo.

We ended up closer to one another and reminisced about '80s movies[^9]. I had a
solid buzz and so didn't hesitate to exclaim about the strange, optimistic, and
otherwise wonderful zeitgeist of '80s teen movies. We watched Max, Dave, and
Mike more, making commentary about all three scenes just between the two of us.

Max closed the doors, since he thought it was later than it actually was and
so didn't want to attract cops or additional clientele.

After sometime, the Trivial Pursuit couple left and so did Patti, Mike, and I.
We said goodbye to Dave, who was properly soused, and Max walked us out. He
asked his round of questions about the trip and I happily responded. I asked a
few about the bar, which he ostensibly owned. He wished us luck, shook our
hands, and Patti snapped a picture.

We walked a block back to the car and started home. Patti and I alternated
choosing music and Mike fell asleep in the back. We drove fast on the
interstate, cutting through the thick dark, south towards Pueblo. Patti passed her
phone to me so I could cue up a track and our hands brushed on one another's for
a little longer than necessary.

We got back to Patti's after midnight. Mike went to the basement immediately
while I hung around in the kitchen.

After a little talk, Patti said she was going upstairs to work on an article for
the local paper. On her way out of the kitchen, she signaled for an embrace. I
took her and, on a hunch, pulled back and kissed her. 

We parted and I went downstairs to the couch, a little short of breath.

[^2]: the Fustilarians were a group of unruly math researchers who annexed the
math computer lab and turned it into an office for themselves, along with
rooting and disassembling various computers, undertaking time-lapse photography

The original group consisted of Tom Stephens, Jeff Snyder, Josh Snyder, Mike
