We woke up in our strangely inclined tent on the morning of day 4 and we were
ambitious. We'd taken half the last day off after the insane bout of climbing
we'd done in hopes that it would prepare us adequately for round two with the
Parkway. What naive children.
 
Waking up was excellent. We were inclined downward, our feet lower than our
heads, and we'd left the window of the tent transluscent so we could see bits of
sunlight stream through the foliage.
                                    
Eventually we got up and began to disassemble tent and do myriad other things
that have become routine over the last few days, e.g.

<ul>
  <li>sterilizing my hands and inserting contact lenses within the tent,</li>
  <li>changing into biking clothes and applying chamois cream in, ahem, the
  right places,</li>
  <li>taking care of business with the help of a tense squat, a half-roll of
  toilet paper, and a trowel,</li>
  <li>disassembling our tent, </li>
  <li>repacking our bikes,,</li>
  <li>recovering the food bags from wherever we hid them from the bears,</li>
</ul>

etc. We've gotten the whole rigamoral down to a routine and, at this point, we
can usually get out of dodge within an hour. This particular morning took a
little longer because we were still a little green behind the ears.
