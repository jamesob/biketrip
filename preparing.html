We were relatively relaxed when it came to training. Both of us bike commute to
school for a 28 mi round-trip for Mike and a 30 mi round-trip for James
(sometimes more). In addition, we sporadically did some weekend rides which
were sometimes documented as well as an overnight trip in Southeastern
North Carolina.
