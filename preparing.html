<p>We were relatively relaxed when it came to training. Both of us bike commute
to school for approximately a 30 mile trip, three days a week. In addition, we
sporadically did some weekend rides which were sometimes documented as well as
an overnight trip in Southeastern North Carolina.</p>

<p>In January 2011, though, James hadn't touched a bike in a few years. This
relaxed training regime worked because we had a solid few months to do it. Had
we not started preparing in the winter, we'd project the length of the trip a
lot higher than 56 days.</p>
