     <p>This is the raw planning material we built up in preparation. It's
     more likely to be up-to-date than the tables below, but it won't give you a
     quick summary of total cost.

<h2>Cost</h2>

<p>One of the motifs of this trip (besides attempting to stay alive) is
to succeed as cheaply as possible.

<h3>Cost for Mike</h3>

<p>Mike, bike geek that he is, initially had a fair inventory of biking equipment
and only picked up around $200 in extra bike hardware.

<h3>Cost for James</h3>

<p>James started at nada and had to scrounge together a bike, "future clothes,"
panniers, and all the other assorted gear necessary for a slipshod cross-country
ride.
