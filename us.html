<h2>Here's what they look like beforehand, anyway...</h2>

<div id="bios">
  <div id="mike-bio">
    <img class="bio" src="/images/mike.jpg" />

    <p>Mike is a hasher, so it's very safe to say that he's also out of his
    mind. He initially concocted this grand scheme and will very likely be doing
    most of the cooking on trail (french omelettes ftw). Mike enjoys
    contemplative walks by the beach, candle-lit beer dinners, and performing
    maintenance on just about any piece of machinery in sight.

  <div id="james-bio">
    <img class="bio" src="/images/james.jpg" />

    <p>James didn't even own a helmet when he signed on to this damn-crazy
    rhubarb.  Fortunately, he does like physical discomfort, vagrancy, and
    low-budget adventure. If, at any point during the trip, he eventually
    exhausts his collection of electronic music, he will implode.
