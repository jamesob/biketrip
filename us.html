    <p>Mike is out of his mind. He initially concocted this grand scheme and 
    will very likely be doing most of the cooking on trail (french omelettes 
    ftw). Mike enjoys running through woods, candle-lit beer 
    dinners, and performing maintenance on just about any piece of machinery 
    in sight.

    <p>James didn't even own a helmet when he signed on to this damn-crazy
    rhubarb.  Fortunately, he does like physical discomfort, vagrancy, and
    low-budget adventure. If, at any point during the trip, he eventually
    exhausts his collection of electronic music, he will implode.
